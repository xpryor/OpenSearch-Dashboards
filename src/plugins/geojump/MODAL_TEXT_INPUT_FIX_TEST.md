# Modal Text Input Bug Fix - Manual Test Guide

## Overview
This document provides manual testing instructions to verify that the modal text input bug has been fixed. The bug prevented users from selecting text in input fields when maps were present, as map dragging events would interfere with text selection.

## What Was Fixed
- Added event handlers to prevent map dragging when interacting with text inputs
- Applied `event.stopPropagation()` for input focus, select, and text selection events
- Fixed text selection, copy/paste, and input field interactions in modal contexts

## Components Fixed
1. **GeojumpPanel** - Main coordinate input field and help popover content
2. **GeojumpTestPanel** - Latitude, longitude, and zoom input fields

## Manual Testing Instructions

### Test 1: Main Coordinate Input Field
1. Open the GeoJump application
2. Navigate to the main GeoJump panel
3. Click in the coordinate input field
4. Type some coordinates: `40.7128, -74.0060`
5. **Test text selection:**
   - Double-click on "40.7128" to select it
   - Verify that the text gets selected (highlighted)
   - Try dragging to select multiple characters
   - Verify that map dragging does NOT occur during text selection
6. **Test copy/paste:**
   - Select the latitude portion: `40.7128`
   - Press Ctrl+C (or Cmd+C on Mac) to copy
   - Clear the field and press Ctrl+V (or Cmd+V) to paste
   - Verify that copy/paste works without triggering map events

### Test 2: Help Popover Content
1. In the GeoJump panel, click the help button (question mark icon)
2. The help popover should open with coordinate format examples
3. **Test text selection in help content:**
   - Try to select text from the coordinate examples (e.g., `40.7128, -74.0060`)
   - Double-click on coordinate examples to select them
   - Verify that text selection works without triggering map dragging
   - Try copying coordinate examples from the help content

### Test 3: Test Panel Input Fields
1. Navigate to the "Test Panel" tab in the GeoJump application
2. **Test latitude input:**
   - Click in the latitude field (default: `40.7128`)
   - Select all text (Ctrl+A or Cmd+A)
   - Verify text selection works without map interference
   - Type a new value and verify input works normally
3. **Test longitude input:**
   - Click in the longitude field (default: `-74.0060`)
   - Double-click to select the entire value
   - Verify selection works without triggering map events
4. **Test zoom input:**
   - Click in the zoom field (default: `12`)
   - Select and modify the value
   - Verify normal input behavior

### Test 4: Compact Mode
1. If there's a compact mode available, test the coordinate input in compact view
2. Verify that text selection works in the compact input field
3. Test the help popover in compact mode

### Test 5: Integration with Map Dragging
1. **Verify map dragging still works:**
   - Click and drag on the map itself (not on input fields)
   - Verify that map dragging functionality is not broken
   - Ensure that only input field interactions are protected
2. **Test normal input functionality:**
   - Enter coordinates and press Enter
   - Verify that the jump functionality still works correctly
   - Ensure that all normal input behaviors are preserved

## Expected Results

### ✅ Success Criteria
- Text can be selected in all input fields without triggering map dragging
- Double-clicking on text in input fields selects the text properly
- Copy/paste operations work normally in input fields
- Help popover content text can be selected and copied
- Map dragging still works when interacting with the map itself
- All normal input functionality (typing, Enter key, etc.) continues to work

### ❌ Failure Indicators
- Text selection in input fields triggers map dragging
- Cannot select text by double-clicking in input fields
- Copy/paste operations don't work or trigger map events
- Help popover text cannot be selected
- Map dragging is completely broken
- Normal input functionality is impaired

## Technical Details

### Event Handlers Added
The following event handlers were added to prevent event propagation:
- `onFocus` - Prevents map focus events when input gains focus
- `onMouseDown` - Prevents map drag start when clicking in input
- `onMouseUp` - Prevents map drag end when releasing mouse in input
- `onSelect` - Prevents map events during text selection
- `onDoubleClick` - Prevents map events during double-click text selection

### Components Modified
1. **src/plugins/geojump/public/components/geojump_panel.tsx**
   - Added event handlers to main coordinate input field
   - Added event handlers to compact mode input field
   - Added event handlers to help popover content container

2. **src/plugins/geojump/public/components/geojump_test_panel.tsx**
   - Added event handlers to latitude input field
   - Added event handlers to longitude input field
   - Added event handlers to zoom level input field

## Troubleshooting

If the fix doesn't work as expected:

1. **Check browser console** for any JavaScript errors
2. **Verify event handlers** are properly attached by inspecting elements
3. **Test in different browsers** to ensure cross-browser compatibility
4. **Check for conflicting event listeners** that might override the fix
5. **Verify map integration** is working correctly in the background

## Requirements Verification

This fix addresses the following requirements:
- **Requirement 2.1**: Text input functionality in modal contexts
- **Requirement 2.2**: Prevention of map dragging interference with text selection

The implementation ensures that users can interact with text inputs normally while maintaining all existing map functionality.
