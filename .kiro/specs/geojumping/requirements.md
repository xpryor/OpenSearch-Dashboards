# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Geojumping feature will enable users to quickly navigate to specific geographic locations within OpenSearch Dashboards maps by inputting coordinates or place names. This feature addresses the critical need for rapid map navigation during mission-critical events, eliminating the current tedious process of manual panning and scrolling. The implementation will integrate seamlessly with existing OpenSearch Service mapping capabilities and leverage the underlying geo-capabilities already present in the OpenSearch backend.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a dashboard user, I want to input latitude and longitude coordinates into a form field, so that I can quickly navigate to a specific geographic location on the map.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses the map interface THEN the system SHALL display a geojump input control that is easily accessible
2. WHEN a user enters valid latitude and longitude coordinates THEN the system SHALL accept decimal degrees format (e.g., 40.78839874, -111.9779968)
3. WHEN a user submits valid coordinates THEN the system SHALL automatically center the map on the specified location
4. WHEN the map centers on the specified location THEN the system SHALL apply an appropriate zoom level to clearly show the target area
5. IF invalid coordinates are entered THEN the system SHALL display a clear error message indicating the correct format

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a dashboard user, I want to input place names or addresses, so that I can navigate to locations without knowing exact coordinates.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user enters a place name or address THEN the system SHALL attempt to resolve it to geographic coordinates
2. WHEN multiple locations match the input THEN the system SHALL provide a selection list for the user to choose from
3. WHEN a place name is successfully resolved THEN the system SHALL center the map on the resolved coordinates
4. IF a place name cannot be resolved THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate error message
5. WHEN resolving place names THEN the system SHALL provide suggestions or autocomplete functionality

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a dashboard user, I want the target location to be temporarily marked on the map, so that I can easily identify where I navigated to.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the map centers on a specified location THEN the system SHALL place a temporary marker at the target coordinates
2. WHEN a temporary marker is displayed THEN it SHALL be visually distinct from other map elements
3. WHEN a user performs another geojump THEN the system SHALL remove the previous temporary marker
4. WHEN a temporary marker is displayed THEN it SHALL automatically disappear after a configurable time period
5. WHEN a temporary marker is displayed THEN the system SHALL optionally show a popup with the coordinates or location name

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a dashboard user, I want to use multiple coordinate input formats, so that I can work with coordinates in my preferred format.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user enters coordinates THEN the system SHALL support decimal degrees format (DD.dddd)
2. WHEN a user enters coordinates THEN the system SHALL support degrees-minutes-seconds format (DMS)
3. WHEN a user enters coordinates THEN the system SHALL support degrees-decimal minutes format (DDM)
4. WHEN coordinates are entered in any supported format THEN the system SHALL automatically detect and parse the format
5. IF an unsupported coordinate format is entered THEN the system SHALL provide format examples and guidance

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a dashboard user, I want the option to update the dashboard's map extent based on my geojump input, so that I can control how the navigation affects my current view.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN performing a geojump THEN the system SHALL provide a toggle option to update the map extent
2. WHEN the update extent option is enabled THEN the system SHALL adjust the map bounds to include the target location
3. WHEN the update extent option is disabled THEN the system SHALL only center the map without changing the zoom level
4. WHEN the map extent is updated THEN the system SHALL preserve any existing filters or queries
5. WHEN the map extent is updated THEN the system SHALL maintain compatibility with dashboard refresh and time range controls

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a dashboard administrator, I want the geojumping feature to integrate seamlessly with existing OpenSearch Dashboards, so that it maintains consistency with the current user interface and functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the geojump feature is implemented THEN it SHALL follow existing OpenSearch Dashboards UI design patterns
2. WHEN the geojump feature is active THEN it SHALL not interfere with existing map controls and functionality
3. WHEN the geojump feature is used THEN it SHALL maintain compatibility with existing geo-queries and filters
4. WHEN the geojump feature is implemented THEN it SHALL leverage existing OpenSearch geo-capabilities
5. WHEN the geojump feature is deployed THEN it SHALL not require changes to existing dashboard configurations

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a dashboard user, I want the geojumping functionality to be performant and responsive, so that I can quickly navigate during time-sensitive operations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user submits coordinates THEN the system SHALL respond within 2 seconds under normal network conditions
2. WHEN resolving place names THEN the system SHALL provide autocomplete suggestions within 500ms of typing
3. WHEN the map centers on a location THEN the transition SHALL be smooth and visually appealing
4. WHEN multiple geojumps are performed rapidly THEN the system SHALL handle them gracefully without performance degradation
5. WHEN the geojump feature is used THEN it SHALL not significantly impact overall dashboard performance
